DESCRIPTION:
	This is a suite of scripts and programs that query various sources for
	metadata about local music files. They produce a database containing
	information from all the sources compiled into one line for each file.
	It is intended to be used to collect information about tracks played for
	royalty payments.

	There are 22 fields per line in the output, and they are defined as follows
	General:
		1: File Name
	On Disk Data (in the metadata stored in the files)
		2: Track Title
		3: Track Number
		4: Artist
		5: Album 
		6: Release Date
		7: Label
		8: Genre/CDDB Category
		9: CDDB ID
	Data Extracted from Musicbrainz:
		10: Track Title
		11: Artist
		12: Album
		13: Release Date
		14: Label
		15: Genre
		16: CDDB ID
		17: ISRC
	Data Extracted from FreeDB:
		18: Track Title
		19: Artist
		20: Album
		21: Date
		22: Label
		23: Genre/CDDB Category

BUILD:
	To build the suite, simply run
		$ make
	in the root directory.

DEPENDENCIES:
	to run:
		python 2.7
		musicbrainz2
		mutagen (be sure to use a version built for python 2)
	for building only:
		gcc
		libcddb

USAGE:
	To generate the a database, use the wrapper script gendb.sh
		$ ./gendb.sh <music dir> > db.txt

KNOWN BUGS:
	-Under some circumstances, musicbrainz will return an album from the
	 publisher "Pastel Music" when it doesn't find the correct album. This
	 appears to be some sort of default album, but it may also be a bug in
	 my query script... further investigation is needed.
	-Currently, the gendb.sh doesn't query freedb at all, as very few tracks
	 in our collection have cddb id's in the metadata. An alternate method
	 for searching freedb needs to be implemented.

TO DO:
	- Add ability to write tags back to files for easy indexing
